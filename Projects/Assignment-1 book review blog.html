            I loved Kingdom of the Wicked, the first in the trilogy by Kerri Maniscalco, but I loooooved Kingdom of the Cursed! The book picks up where Kingdom of the Wicked left off. Emilia has decided to enter a deal with Pride so she can hopefully find out who was behind the murder of her sister, Vittoria.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Additional Thoughts:</h3>
            <p class="add thoughts">
                Well this didn't fully live up to book one. Perhaps my expectation was to high or perhaps it just felt bit more of the same. Now don't get me wrong, I liked how it dived more into each Prince of Hell and their story. I liked you got to see more of the kingdom and realm they rule over and their laws and politically correct standards. What I don't like is how it felt it was just all one big lead up to Kingdom of the Feared.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p class="concl">
            “Kingdom of the Cursed final chapters were the best part of the book. It gave me hope for an epic conclusion for the final book to this series.”

                It is the start of a new series by Amélie Wen Zhao. An epic story in the crossover territory between YA and adult fantasy, strongly influenced by Zhao’s Chinese background and multicultural upbringing and full of immersive prose, this will whisk you away and immerse you completely.</p>
